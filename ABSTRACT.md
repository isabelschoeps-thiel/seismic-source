### Abstract

 Conventional seismic prospecting in high-altitude, strongly undulating mountainous regions is severely constrained by the difficulty of source deployment and the challenge of maintaining data acquisition quality. To address these limitations, this study conducts, for the first time, a seismic exploration experiment in a typical high-elevation and rugged terrain area using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) seismic sources. The acquired records exhibit consistently high signal-to-noise ratios across the effective frequency band, with clear first arrivals and identifiable reflection phases. First-arrival tomography, stacking, and post-stack migration imaging all produce results sufficient for high-precision subsurface characterization. Benefiting from its excellent terrain adaptability, positional accuracy, and stable data acquisition capability, the UAV seismic source represents an economical, efficient, and environmentally friendly alternative for seismic exploration in complex mountainous regions, showing strong potential for broader geophysical applications.
